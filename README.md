# This is a simple WYSIWYG editor made with Tiptap in React

## Adding Extra Functionality
You can just add an extension from the official [tiptap website](tiptap.dev/extensions). You can just add a button (of which there are two types, *toggle able* and *non toggle able*). 
I also created a *Dropdown* component which can be further extended.

## Future Work
- I am planning on adding collaborative editing.
- Refining the CSS
